This is the Byggern project...

This team is made up of Johan Lofstad, Sondre Baugst√∏ and Sondre Vincent Russvoll. 



Documentation is available at \href{https://srussvoll.github.io/byggern/}{\tt https\+://srussvoll.\+github.\+io/byggern/}. 



The \textquotesingle{}build\textquotesingle{} folder contains all build files like .hex and .elf. The \textquotesingle{}include\textquotesingle{} folder contains all header files. The \textquotesingle{}lib\textquotesingle{} folder contains folders with libraries containing both source and header files. The \textquotesingle{}src\textquotesingle{} folder contains the source files. 



Added C++ support. Note that the S\+TL isn\textquotesingle{}t implemented. More specifically, only the C standard library is available... The new and delete operators are not implemented either, so just don\textquotesingle{}t use dynamic allocation without malloc(). Also remember that I\+S\+Rs are implemented in C with no support for overloading... Because of this interrupt handlers must be friends of the originator class.
