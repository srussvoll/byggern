 * \brief I2C (TWI) for communicating for peripherals
 *
 * This implementation is based on the http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2564-Using-the-TWI-Module-as-I2C-Master_ApplicationNote_AVR315.pdf device driver example
 * Most of the implementation is ported from ATMEL/AVRs C IAR example code found in the link.
 * However, we had to port it to C++ and the avrgcc compiler.
 * Note that we were not asked to create this driver, so the implementation is due to ATMEL
